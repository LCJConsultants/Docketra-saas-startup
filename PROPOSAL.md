# Docketra — AI-Powered Legal Practice Management

**Built for Solo Attorneys & Small Firms**

---

## Executive Summary

Docketra is a modern, all-in-one legal practice management platform that combines case management, document automation, time tracking, billing, and AI-powered drafting into a single, secure workspace. Designed specifically for solo practitioners and small law firms, Docketra eliminates the need to juggle multiple tools — your cases, clients, documents, calendar, emails, and billing all live in one place.

What sets Docketra apart is its **AI legal assistant** — an intelligent copilot that can draft motions, schedule court dates, log billable time, search your caseload, and file documents, all through a natural language conversation.

## What Docketra Can Do

### 1. Case Management

Manage your entire caseload from a centralized dashboard. Each case tracks:

- **Case type** (Criminal, Civil, Divorce, Custody, Mediation, and more)
- **Case status** (Open, Pending, Closed, Archived) with color-coded badges
- **Case number and title** for quick identification
- **Client association** — every case links to a client record
- **Court information** — court name, presiding judge
- **Opposing party and counsel** names for quick reference
- **Statute of limitations** date tracking
- **Tags** for custom categorization and filtering
- **Full description** with preserved formatting

Each case detail page features a **tabbed interface** with a Timeline (showing all linked calendar events), Documents (files attached to the case), and Billing (time entries and invoices). Attorneys can filter cases by status, type, or search — making it easy to find what you need across hundreds of matters.

### 2. Client Directory

Maintain a complete client directory with:

- Contact information (name, phone, email, mailing address)
- Date of birth and internal notes
- Client status tracking (Active, Inactive, Archived)
- Direct links to all associated cases
- Pagination for firms managing large client bases

### 3. AI Legal Assistant

Docketra's AI assistant is more than a chatbot — it's a **tool-calling agent** that can take action directly within your practice management system. Through natural conversation, the AI can:

**Draft Legal Documents**
- Generate motions, pleadings, letters, contracts, and agreements
- Draft from your **uploaded templates** — the AI reads extracted text from your real documents and produces similar ones tailored to the current case
- Draft from scratch with full case context (client name, court, judge, opposing counsel, case details)
- All drafts are saved directly to your document library

**Manage Your Calendar**
- Create court dates, filing deadlines, meetings, and reminders
- Set specific times, locations, and case associations
- Configure multiple reminder alerts
- Events automatically sync to Google Calendar if connected

**Search Your Practice**
- Find cases by status or type
- Look up client details by name
- Retrieve upcoming events and deadlines
- Get full case summaries with all associated information

**Track Billable Time**
- Log time entries with case, description, duration, and hourly rate
- Mark entries as billable or non-billable
- Specify dates for retroactive logging

**File Documents**
- Upload files directly through the chat interface
- Attach uploaded documents to specific cases
- Categorize documents automatically

The AI receives full case context when working within a case — including client information, court details, opposing counsel, and case description — so every action is informed and relevant.

### 4. Document Management

A complete document management system with:
